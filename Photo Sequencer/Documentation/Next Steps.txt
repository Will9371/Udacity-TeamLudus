Design:
- Set of 5 images telling a story
	- Use the 360 degree camera in Google Streetview 
	(stitches together multiple photographs)
	- More sets of images = better!
- Fancier pedestals, or some other static object that acts as a container for the images
- Scene environment
- Orbs glow when user hovering over them?

Mechanics:
