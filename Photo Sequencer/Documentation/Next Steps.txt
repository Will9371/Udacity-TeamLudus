* = Items needed for a complete project
+ = Items project should have, but not absolutely necessary

Design:
*- Set of 5 images telling a story
	- Use the 360 degree camera in Google Streetview 
	(stitches together multiple photographs)
	- More sets of images = better!
+- Fancier pedestals, or some other static object that acts as a container for the images
+- Scene environment
- Image Orbs glow when user hovering over them (or in some way show the user they are being aimed at)

Mechanics:
*- Randomize order of images on start of game
*- Determine when player has the images in the correct order
*- Reset puzzle on completion
- Option to switch to a different puzzle, there are several ways this could be done
	- Option 1: forward and backwards buttons that swap out sets of orbs
	- Option 2: Picture sets are in a series, player moves between them like levels
	- Option 3: Other ideas??
- Continuous movement when image orbs move from one pedestal to another
- Continuous movement during transition from game mode to view image mode
